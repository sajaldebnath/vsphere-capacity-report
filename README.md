# vsphere-capacity-report
Holds the PowerShell script for generating vSphere Capacity Report
There are two files in this folder, Get-Capacity.ps1 is the original powershell script and when run will generate the report in html format. "vcenter.lab.com_Capacity_Report_8-9-2015-23-46.html" is the sample report in html format. So if you need a sample, download it and check for the output.
